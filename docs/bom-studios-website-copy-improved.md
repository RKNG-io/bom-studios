## ABOUT

**Hi, I'm Jeroen.**

I started BOM Studios because I kept seeing the same thing: good businesses, invisible online.

They knew they needed to post. They just didn't have time to figure out what, how, or when. So I built a service that takes the whole problem off their plate.

You work with me directly. No account managers, no agency runaround. I create content that fits your business — and actually gets posted.

Based in Amsterdam. Working with businesses across the Netherlands and beyond.
