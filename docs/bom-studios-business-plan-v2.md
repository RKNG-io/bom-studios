# 🇳🇱 BOM STUDIOS — BUSINESS PLAN

**Market:** Dutch SMEs (Randstad focus) + Online Coaches  
**Proposition:** Done-for-you social video content. AI-accelerated, human-crafted.

---

## 1. THE PROBLEM

Dutch SMEs know they need social media. They don't have time, ideas, or consistency.  
Marketing is the first thing they outsource—but agencies are expensive and slow.

---

## 2. THE OFFER

Monthly social video content: strategy → scripts → production → posting → reporting.

Internally: video engine + automation.  
Externally: you sell *marketing results*, not "AI".

## 3. DUTCH MARKET FIT

| They Value | They Dislike |
|------------|--------------|
| Fixed pricing, clarity | Overhyped claims, jargon |
| Reliability ("afspraak is afspraak") | Complex onboarding |
| Local trust, modest confidence | "AI magic" positioning |
| Visual quality (NL is design-savvy) | Cheap templates |

**Platforms:** Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn (very strong in NL), YouTube Shorts, Facebook.

---

## 4. PACKAGES

| Tier | Price | What's Included |

## 6. GO-TO-MARKET

1. **Website:** Simple, bilingual, transparent pricing, clear process, examples.
2. **Content:** Behind-the-scenes, ad breakdowns, tips. Jeroen on camera (authentic > polished).
3. **Local outreach:** DM local businesses, free audits, presence in gyms/salons.
4. **Coaches:** Easier to convert—they already want authority-building content.
5. **Referrals:** €50 credit per referral.
